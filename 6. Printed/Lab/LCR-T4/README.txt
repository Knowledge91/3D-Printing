# Summary

This is a case for the LCR-T4 variant of the quite wonderful universal transistor and component tester developed by Markus Frejek, and later Karl-Heinz KÃ¼bbeler. A full description of the project is available here:  

http://mikrocontroller.net/articles/AVR_Transistortester  

This case fits the variant with graphical display sold on Ebay and elsewhere called LCR-T4. The case includes a compartment for the battery, and gives access to the surface mount component test area. The pinout for the 14 pin ZIF test socket is printed on the case, for reference.  Note that there are several different variants of this tester in the market. This case is only designed to fit the LCR-T4.  

You need four M3x15 countersunk screws for assembling the top and bottom sections.  

Note that the PCB for this case is the T4. The T4 is somewhat similar to the T3 PCB, but it is not the same, and does not fit the same case. There are also other variants out there. Please examine the pictures of the PCB carefully to make sure you have the right PCB before you start your print. A case for the T3 is available here:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:694790 Another case are here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1580922 and here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1920077 A case for a variant with alphanumeric display is here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:641003

Note: The variant glcd_tester_lcr_t4_extra has room for a PCB that is up to 2 mm larger on the righthand side. Some versions of the T4 seems to have this larger PCB. This variant will also work with the original PCB. Note that this variant is not tested (yet). 

# Instructions

Should print without support, and with not too much cleanup. If warping is an issue, you may consider adding a brim. The top section should be printed upside-down.
