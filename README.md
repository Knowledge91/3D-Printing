# 3D Printing
Directories 1-4 are from the SD-card shipped with the Ender-3. In *4. 
Calibrations* I save the `.stl`, `factory` (*simplify3D*) and `.gcode` files.

## Sofware that I use
- **Cura**
- **Simplify3D** for switching my settings for different layers. Simplify3D 
offers *proccesses*, with a start and maximum layer number. You have to setup
the bed-heating by adding a *temperature controller* with `T1=60`.
